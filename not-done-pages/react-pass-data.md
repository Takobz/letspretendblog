Hello, Reader! ðŸ™‚, It's been a while since I posted something.  
In my quest to start with [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) I found something interesting about passing data around from component to component and I want to talk about it because it was justa amazing!  

Without wasting any time let's dive straight into the concepts.

### A Component
As you might know ReactJs uses components to build up it's user interface. A component can be anything ranging from a Card, Widget that consists of a text input and a button or simply a div with text.

The idea of these components is to have UI elements that we can re-use and call as you would call a normal html tag like `div` `h1` etc.  This

Below is how a component is created in ReactJs. This component just renders the text **Parent Component** on the screen:

``` js
import React from 'react';

const ParentComponent = () => {
    return(
    <>
    <h1>Parent Component</h1>
    </>)
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

If we reference this component in the App.js like this:
``` js
import './App.css';
import ParentComponent from './Components/ParentComponent';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ParentComponent />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We will see this:

### Parent-Child Components
If you noticed above I called the Parent Component inside the `return()` function of App.js (a component) this means that the Parent component is the child of the App.js component.  

To make this a little clear I will create a component called ChildComponent and this will be called inside the Parent component. Here is how the child will look like:  
``` js
import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = () => {
    return(<>
    <h3>Hello I am a child Component Of ParentComponent</h3>
    </>)
}

export default ChildComponent;
```

In the parent component I will do this:  
``` js
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
    return(
    <>
    <h1>Parent Component</h1>
    <ChildComponent />
    </>)
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

This will give me the result:

::: note
In the ParentComponent I will just reference this file with `import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';`. These two files ChildComponent and ParentComponent are in the same directory.
