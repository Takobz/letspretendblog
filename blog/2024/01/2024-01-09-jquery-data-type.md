Hello There (General Kenobi) In this blog post we will be looking at how JQuery's AJAX call can think your successful AJAX calls are not successful only because of the dataType you used when calling a remote API.

### What is JQuery and AJAX.

#### What is JQuery?
Well in the world of web development [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is pretty famous it is a library that allowed web developers to make their websites more dynamic and do edgy stuff without doing a lot of vanilla javascript, yes there was still a lot of heavy lifting were they needed to do a lot of work for themselves when manipulating the DOM.  

JQuery was (and still is) amazing because it allows you to use selector to manipulate DOM elements like divs, p1, h1, etc. It also has capabilities to insert html into the DOM with the `.html(data)` function where data is any html you want to insert.  

Apart from that JQuery allowed developers to change styling on the fly as they need to with the help of the `.css()` function. Below is an example of how we can use JQuery by simply just changing the text of a div and inserting some h1 tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#myDiv p").text("This is the new text for the paragraph.");
        $("#myDiv").append("<h1>This is a new H1 heading</h1>");
    });
    </script>
</head>
<body>

<div id="myDiv">
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>
```

JQuery uses selectors to find elements in the DOM. To find any element with and id we use the hash symbol (#) in my example because my div has id myDiv to select that element using JQuery I just go `$("#myDiv")` you can even store this in a variable and console.log() it to see how a DOM element looks. In the above example the first line in my script finds my div by id then looks for any p child inside the div then changes the text using the `.text()` method.  

A line later I use the `append()` method to append a child to my div this will add a new h1 tag to my div. This is just a simple example to try and show you how JQuery works, you can copy the HTML then serve in any web server you like locally and you will the result ðŸ™ƒ

:::note
You may have noticed the use of `$(document).ready(function(){...})` in the example, this is best practice as it lets JQuery wait for the DOM to be ready before starting to manipulate it, it is best practice to have your JQuery inside of the function if you want your JQuery to execute as soon as the DOM is fully loaded otherwise in the case of creating, say, onclick event functions that will be used when you click a button then it's okay because your function will run when the DOM is loaded i.e. when you are able to click buttons etc.

:::tip
Make sure you always import your jquery first from you cdn then followed by the script that uses JQuery as seen in my head tag of my html document. This is because the JQuery function `$` wouldn't have been loaded if you start with a script that JQuery dependency.

#### What is AJAX?
AJAX stands Asynchronous Javascript And XML. It is used for sending HTTP request to the server from your web app in manner that doesn't load up the whole page, it is useful for sending requests then dynamically changing your page.  

With plain javascript a AJAX object can be initialised using the new keyword as follows: `var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();`.

##### JQuery's AJAX
JQuery has a way to use AJAX functionality without needing to initiliaze the `XLMHttpRequest` which becomes tedious real fast. To do that we have a `$.ajax({...})` where we give our ajax method some values as follows:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $.ajax({
            url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts",
            method: "GET",
            beforeSend: function(){
                console.log("loading")
            },
            success: function(result){
                console.log(result);
                $("body").append("<p>Data received!</p>");
            },
            error: function(error){
                console.log(error);
                $("body").append("<p>An error occurred.</p>");
            }
        });
    });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

I served the above HTML with `npx server` and got the follwing result:
![jquery-call](../../../static/img/blog-images/jquery-data-type/send-jquery-to-get-json-back.png)

The json we passed in the `$.ajax({...})` method had the following properties and here's what they mean:
- url:
- method:
- dataType:
- beforeSend:
- success:
- error
